After receiving multiple complaints, and also growing more and more frustrated with Mediums lack of proper syntax highlighting or general embedding qualities, I've decided to give GitHub pages (Jekyll) a spin. I am actually pretty pleased with Jekyll so far -- even though I don't particulary like Ruby, I find Jekyll pretty cool.

And there exist a number of nice themes. For this blog I have forked the "hitchens" [theme by Pat Dryburgh](https://patdryburgh.com/blog/introducing-hitchens/). So big thanks to Pat for designing such a nice theme. 
I do believe I have slightly improved the syntax highlighting but otherwise it was pretty perfect!

So off we go!
